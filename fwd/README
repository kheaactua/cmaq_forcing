major changes in this directory are:
1) This now uses KPP v2.1 generated files and Integrators. With that comes RK solvers.
2) This has vadv in tridiagonal matrix format. It doesn't change anything compared to 
   original code, but it makes it easier to compare with the adjoint/transpose code.
3) In this version photolysis rates are checkpointed to avoid the bug in phot.F
5) And I'm sure a couple of other things that I don't rememeber now.

And as usual check for BF perturbations left from previous runs, in routines such 
as INITSCEN or DRIVER or all process subroutines.
